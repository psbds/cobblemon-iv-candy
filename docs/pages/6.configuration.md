## Configuration File Location

The configuration file is automatically created when the mod first runs and is located at:

```
config/cobblemon_iv_candy.json
```

This file is in JSON format and can be edited with any text editor. The mod will automatically create this file with default values if it doesn't exist.

## How to Edit Configuration

1. **Stop your Minecraft server** (if running on a server)
2. **Navigate to the config folder** in your Minecraft installation directory
3. **Open `cobblemon_iv_candy.json`** with any text editor
4. **Modify the values** according to your preferences
5. **Save the file**
6. **Restart your Minecraft server** or reload the mod

{: .warning }
> **Important:** All percentage values must be between 0 and 100. The mod will automatically validate these values and reset invalid ones to defaults.

---

## Drop Mechanics

### How Drops Work

- **Species Drops**: All non-special Pokémon (regular, non-legendary/mythical/ultra beast/paradox) can drop Species IV Shards
- **Type Drops**: All Pokémon can drop Type IV Shards based on their primary and secondary types
- **Special Drops**: Legendary, Mythical, Ultra Beast, and Paradox Pokémon drop their respective special shards

### Drop Priority

When a Pokémon is defeated, the mod checks for drops in this order:
1. **Special category drops** (Legendary/Mythical/Ultra Beast/Paradox) - these override species drops
2. **Type-specific drops** - checked for all Pokémon regardless of category
3. **Species drops** - only for regular (non-special) Pokémon

### Multiple Type Pokémon

Pokémon with dual types have separate chances to drop shards for each of their types. For example, a Fire/Flying type Pokémon can potentially drop both Fire IV Shards and Flying IV Shards in a single encounter.

## Configuration Validation

The mod automatically validates configuration values when loading:

- **Percentage values** are clamped between 0 and 100
- **Invalid configurations** are backed up and reset to defaults
- **Missing values** are filled in with default values
- **Validation errors** are logged for troubleshooting

---

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Loading

If your configuration changes aren't taking effect:

1. Check the game/server logs for validation errors
2. Ensure the JSON syntax is correct (use a JSON validator if needed)
3. Verify file permissions allow reading/writing
4. Check if a backup file was created (indicates corrupted JSON)

### Backup Files

If the mod detects a corrupted configuration file, it will:
1. Create a backup with timestamp: `cobblemon_iv_candy.json.backup.{timestamp}`
2. Generate a new default configuration
3. Log the issue for review

### Default Values Reset

If you see your custom values reset to defaults, check the logs for validation errors. Common issues:
- Percentage values outside 0-100 range
- Invalid JSON syntax
- Non-numeric values in numeric fields

## Advanced Configuration Tips

### Balanced Gameplay

For balanced gameplay, consider these guidelines:
- Keep regular Pokémon drop chances low (5-15%) to maintain resource scarcity
- Special Pokémon (Legendary/Mythical) can have higher rates since they're rarer
- Adjust drop amounts based on your server's economy and progression speed

### Server Performance

Higher drop chances don't significantly impact performance, but consider:
- Very high drop amounts may flood inventory quickly
- Frequent drops may increase item entity counts temporarily

### Economy Integration

If using economy mods, consider:
- Lower drop rates for more valuable progression
- Higher drop amounts if items will be traded frequently
- Balance against other resource-gathering mechanics
