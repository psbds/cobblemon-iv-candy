## Item Categories

### 🔮 [IV Shards](../shards/)
IV Shards are the **raw materials** used to craft IV Candies. They are obtained when Pokémon faint and serve as the foundation for the candy crafting system.

**Key Features:**
- Dropped by defeated Pokémon
- Multiple types based on species, elements, and special categories  
- Cannot be crafted manually
- Used as crafting components for IV Candies

**Types Available:**
- **Species Shards**: Specific to individual Pokémon species
- **Elemental Shards**: Based on the 18 Pokémon types
- **Special Shards**: From Legendary, Mythical, Ultra Beast, and Paradox Pokémon

### 🍬 [IV Candies](../candies/)
IV Candies are **consumable items** that enhance a Pokémon's Individual Values when used. They are crafted from IV Shards using specific recipes.

**Key Features:**
- Crafted from IV Shards using recipes
- Enhance Pokémon IVs when used
- Available in targeted and random variants
- Compatible with specific Pokémon based on candy type

**Enhancement Types:**
- **Targeted Candies**: Improve specific IV stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)

### ⚡ [IV Extractors](../extractors/)
IV Extractors are **specialized tools** that harvest perfect Individual Values from Pokémon and convert them into IV Candies. They provide a way to redistribute IVs between Pokémon.

**Key Features:**
- Extract perfect IVs (value 31) from Pokémon
- Convert extracted IVs into targeted candies
- Reduce extracted stats to minimum value (1)
- Compatible with specific Pokémon types and categories

**Extractor Types:**

## How They Work Together

### The Enhancement Process

1. **🔥 Battle Pokémon** → Defeat wild or trainer Pokémon
2. **💎 Collect Shards** → Shards drop based on the defeated Pokémon's characteristics
3. **⚒️ Craft Items** → Use shards to create IV Candies or IV Extractors
4. **🍬 Enhance Pokémon** → Use candies on your Pokémon to improve their IVs
5. **⚡ Extract IVs** → Use extractors to harvest perfect IVs and create more candies
6. **📈 Repeat Process** → Continue to maximize your team's potential

### Item Relationship Flow

```
Battle → Shards → Candies → Enhanced Pokémon
                ↓
              Extractors → Harvest Perfect IVs → More Candies
```

### Compatibility System

The compatibility between shards, candies, extractors, and Pokémon follows a logical system:

```
Species Shard → Species Candy → Works on that species line
Fire Shard → Fire Candy/Extractor → Works on Fire-type Pokémon
Legendary Shard → Legendary Candy/Extractor → Works on Legendary Pokémon
```

This system ensures that you need to engage with different types of Pokémon to enhance your entire team effectively.
