## How They Work Together

### The Enhancement Process

1. **üî• Battle Pok√©mon** ‚Üí Defeat wild or trainer Pok√©mon
2. **üíé Collect Shards** ‚Üí Shards drop based on the defeated Pok√©mon's characteristics
3. **‚öíÔ∏è Craft Candies** ‚Üí Use shards with other ingredients to create IV Candies
4. **üç¨ Enhance Pok√©mon** ‚Üí Use candies on your Pok√©mon to improve their IVs
5. **üìà Repeat Process** ‚Üí Continue to maximize your Pok√©mon's potential

### Compatibility System

The compatibility between shards, candies, and Pok√©mon follows a logical system:

```
Species Shard ‚Üí Species Candy ‚Üí Works on that species line
Fire Shard ‚Üí Fire Candy ‚Üí Works on Fire-type Pok√©mon
Legendary Shard ‚Üí Legendary Candy ‚Üí Works on Legendary Pok√©mon
```

This system ensures that you need to engage with different types of Pok√©mon to enhance your entire team effectively.
