- **Effect**: Increases the specified IV by 1 point (up to maximum of 31)
- **Naming**: Shows the target stat in brackets (e.g., "Pikachu IV Candy [Attack]")
- **Advantage**: Precise control over which stat to improve

#### Available Target Stats

### üé≤ Random IV Candies

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "This candy cannot be used on this Pok√©mon"
- **Cause**: Compatibility mismatch between candy and target Pok√©mon
- **Solution**: Check candy type matches Pok√©mon species/type/category

#### "This Pok√©mon's IVs are already maximized"
- **Cause**: All target Pok√©mon's IVs are at maximum (31)
- **Solution**: Use candy on a different Pok√©mon or for different stats

#### "No eligible stats to improve"
- **Cause**: For random candies, all IVs are at maximum
- **Solution**: The Pok√©mon is fully optimized for this candy type

#### Candy disappears without effect
- **Cause**: Invalid target or server lag
- **Solution**: Ensure valid Pok√©mon target and stable server connection
