# IV Shards
{: .no_toc }

IV Shards are the raw materials used to craft IV Candies. They are obtained when Pok√©mon faint and serve as the foundation for the candy crafting system.

## How to Obtain Shards

- **Pok√©mon Fainting**: When any Pok√©mon faints (wild or owned), it has a chance to drop a shard
- **Automatic Collection**: Shards are automatically generated based on the fainted Pok√©mon's characteristics
- **No Manual Crafting**: Shards cannot be crafted manually - they must be obtained from Pok√©mon
- **Drop Rates**: Configurable through the mod's configuration file (see [Configuration Guide](configuration.html))

## Shard Properties

Each shard contains the following data:
- **Shard Type**: Determines which candy type can be crafted
- **Species Data**: For species shards, stores the Pok√©dex number
- **Elemental Type**: For type shards, stores the type information
- **Visual Model**: Custom textures based on the shard type
- **Unique Identifier**: Ensures proper stacking and identification

---

## Drop Mechanics

### Drop Priority System
When a Pok√©mon faints, the mod checks for drops in this order:
1. **Special category drops** (Legendary/Mythical/Ultra Beast/Paradox) - these override species drops
2. **Type-specific drops** - checked for all Pok√©mon regardless of category
3. **Species drops** - only for regular (non-special) Pok√©mon

### Dual-Type Pok√©mon
Pok√©mon with dual types have separate chances to drop shards for each of their types:
- Each type is rolled independently
- A single Pok√©mon can potentially drop multiple type shards
- Example: A Fire/Flying Pok√©mon can drop both Fire and Flying shards

### Configuration Impact
All drop rates and amounts are configurable:
- **Species drops**: Default 10% chance, 1 shard
- **Type drops**: Default 5% chance, 1 shard  
- **Special category drops**: Default 100% chance, 1 shard
- See [Configuration Guide](configuration.html) for customization options

## Storage and Organization

### Inventory Management
- **Stackable**: Identical shards stack together up to 64
- **Unique Items**: Different types create separate item stacks
- **Storage**: Can be stored in any standard Minecraft container
- **Shulker Boxes**: Compatible for large-scale storage

### Sorting Tips
- **By Category**: Group Species, Elemental, and Special shards separately
- **By Type**: Sort elemental shards by type for easy access
- **By Rarity**: Keep rare special category shards in secure storage
- **By Usage**: Organize based on your current IV enhancement projects

Shards support debug interactions for testing and development:
- **Right-click on any entity**: While holding a shard to see its properties
- **Console Output**: Technical information about the shard's data components
