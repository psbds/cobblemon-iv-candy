# Items Reference

The Cobblemon IV Candy mod introduces two main items: **IV Shards** and **IV Candies**. These items work together to provide a comprehensive IV enhancement system for your Pok√©mon.

IV Shards are the raw materials used to craft IV Candies. They are obtained when Pok√©mon faint and serve as the foundation for the candy crafting system.
